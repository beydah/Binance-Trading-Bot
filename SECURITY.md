## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue.** This could expose the vulnerability to malicious actors before a patch is released.
2.  Email your findings to the maintainer (or open a draft Security Advisory if you have access).
3.  Include details about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work towards a resolution.
